# UnityPongGame
Here I have a newer version of 1972 classic, Pong, which I created using C# and the Unity Game Engine. Everything in the game was scripted in C#, from the ball vectors, to the forces/dynamics of the objects in the game and custom computer-player AI. This project was a lot of fun and really tested my experience in OOP (object-oriented-programming). To play click the link above, hit play, and unmute the audio.
